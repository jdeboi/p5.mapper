 This library is designed to making projection mapping easy using the popular, easy-to-learn JavaScript library, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

 ### Installation
 You'll find the library, `p5.mapper.min.js`, in the dist folder of this repo. Include the library in your `index.html` (after loading p5.js):

 ```html
 <script type="text/javascript" src="p5.mapper.min.js"></script>
 ```

### Examples

 
 ### Acknowledgements

 The logic of this library builds upon and/or adapts:
 * [David Bouchard's (Java) Processing Keystone Library](http://keystonep5.sourceforge.net/)
 * [Jenny Louthan, projection transform algorithms](https://github.com/jlouthan/perspective-transform) 




maybe we load by quad / tri, not "p5mapper". and only allow drawing after it exists

what happens when keypressed?

... ?
