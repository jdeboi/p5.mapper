# p5.mapper

p5.mapper is a projection mapping library for [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). This library makes it easy to code and keystone interactive, algorithmic sketches. Created by [Jenna deBoisblanc](https://jdeboi.com/).

## Library
You'll find the library, `p5.mapper.min.js`, in the dist folder of this repo. Include the library in your `index.html` (after loading p5.js).

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="p5.mapper.min.js"></script>
```
  
Alternatively, you can get the library through cdn:  
  
```html
<script src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jdeboi/p5.mapper/main/dist/p5.mapper.min.js"></script>
```
